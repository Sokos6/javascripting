// Weak Maps
// Weak mapswork in the same way as weak sets. They are the same as maps, except their
// keys cannot be primitives, and the garbage collector will automatically remove
// any dead entries when the reference to the original object is deleted.

// To create a weak map, the new operator is used along with the WeakMap() constructor:

// const weak = new WeakMap();
// Weak maps can use the has() , get() , set() and delete() methods in the same way as a regular map.

// Weak maps and sets are useful for optimizing memory usage and avoiding memory leaks, but theyâ€™re
// also limited in that they don't have access to all the methods their regular counterparts have.
// For example, you cannot use the size() method to see how many entries they contain.
// The choice of which to use will depend on what you plan to use them for.
